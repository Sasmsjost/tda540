# Intro

These are the accepted solutions to the part assignments in the course
TDA540 at Chalmers University. The projects was made togetehr with my

# Assignments

Assignment 1-7 where to get comfortable with the syntax and principles
of object oriented programming in Java.

Assignment 8 was the final assignment where everything was put together.
The tower defence wasn't allowed to take any input, everything
was hard coded. It required two paths which where toggleable in code. The
graphics where optional but it was fun seeing what could be done using
Java Swing.
